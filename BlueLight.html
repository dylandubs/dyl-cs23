<h1>Blue Light</h1>
<hr>
<p>Summary of Information</p>
<p><h4> In this day in age, blue light is prominent in technological devices. Blue light sends alarm rays to your brain, convincing you that it's daytime. This wakes you up and keeps you up. This is causing sleep problems for many. That said, there are certain precautions that can be taken to reduce the level of blue light intake. For example, blue light glasses have a protective tint that reduces the strenght of the blue light. Additionally, turning on "Night Shift" on your devices from 12:01am to 11:59pm is a great way to reduces blue light. Cutting out blue light is difficult, but research shows that taking small measure to reduce amounts of blue light intake is effective. </h4></p>
